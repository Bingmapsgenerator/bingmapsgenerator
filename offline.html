            <h2>What is Bing Maps?</h2>
            <p>Bing Maps is a mapping service that was launched in June 2013. It is the successor to Live Search Maps.
It is owned by Microsoft and offers satellite imagery, aerial photography, street maps, 360 degree panoramic views of select locations, real-time traffic updates, route planning for carpools, the ability to work offline with downloaded areas, and "Street Side" views which show buildings and other landmarks as they appear from a near ground level perspective.
Bing Maps offers satellite imagery for most of the Earth's land area and can show images at various scales: The whole planet (the "Earth View"), large portions of the Earth (from "Near View") to close-up views of physical features such as buildings or bridges (from "Street Side"). </p>
